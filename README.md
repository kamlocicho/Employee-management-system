# Employee Management System REST API

This project is a RESTful API built with Java and Spring Boot for managing employee data within an organization. It provides endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, along with full authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features:

- **Employee Management:** Allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.
- **Authentication:** Implements JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
- **Role-based Access Control:** Provides different levels of access based on user roles.
- **RESTful Architecture:** Follows RESTful principles for clear and standardized API design.
- **Scalability:** Designed with scalability in mind to handle growing data and user loads.
- **Spring Boot:** Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for rapid development and easy deployment.

## Technologies Used:

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **Spring Boot:** Provides the foundation for building the RESTful API.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for implementing secure authentication.
- **RESTful API:** Follows REST principles for designing APIs.
- **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation tool.
- **PostgreSQL:** Utilizes a PostgreSQL database for storing employee data.

## Usage:

1. **Authentication:** Users authenticate using JWT by providing valid credentials.
2. **Employee Management:** CRUD operations can be performed on employee records by authorized users.
3. **Role-based Access Control:** Different user roles have varying levels of access to API endpoints.
4. **Scalability:** The API is designed to scale with the organization's needs, handling increasing data and user loads effectively.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the database connection in the application properties file.
3. Build and run the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.

## Future Enhancements:

- **Additional Functionality:** Implement additional features such as reporting, analytics, or notifications.
- **Teams** Implement grouping users in Teams and managing whole teams (adding tasks etc.).
- **UI Integration:** Develop a user interface for easier interaction with the API.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize database queries and API endpoints for better performance.
- **Security Enhancements:** Continuously improve security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
- **Integration Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and stability.

This Employee Management System REST API provides a robust solution for organizations to efficiently manage their employee data with secure authentication and scalable architecture.
